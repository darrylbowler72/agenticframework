# User Story: Implement DevOps Chatbot for Natural Language Agent Interaction

## Epic
Developer Experience & Intelligent Operations

## Story
**As a** developer or DevOps engineer
**I want** to interact with the agentic framework through natural language via a chatbot (Slack/Teams)
**So that** I can perform common DevOps tasks, query system status, and get insights without navigating multiple tools

## Priority
**High** - Enhances accessibility and reduces friction for common operations

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] Chatbot deployed and accessible in Slack workspace
- [ ] Bot responds to natural language queries and commands
- [ ] Authentication and authorization integrated
- [ ] Core command categories supported:
  - **Status Queries**: "What's the status of user-service deployment?", "Show me failed pipelines"
  - **Workflow Triggers**: "Create a new microservice called payment-service", "Deploy user-service to staging"
  - **Observability Insights**: "Show me errors in the last hour", "Why is the API slow?"
  - **Policy Checks**: "Check if my terraform plan is compliant", "What policy violations exist?"
- [ ] Bot provides actionable responses with links to relevant dashboards/tools
- [ ] Conversation context is maintained within a session
- [ ] Bot handles ambiguous requests with clarifying questions
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly with suggested next steps

### Should Have
- [ ] Bot supports interactive components:
  - Buttons for common actions (Approve deployment, Retry pipeline)
  - Dropdown menus for environment/service selection
  - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- [ ] Rich formatting in responses:
  - Tables for deployment history
  - Code blocks for logs/configs
  - Inline status indicators (✅ ❌ ⚠️)
- [ ] Bot can explain its reasoning:
  - "Why was this pipeline flagged?" → Shows policy violations
  - "How did you determine this anomaly?" → Shows metrics analysis
- [ ] Conversation history stored for audit purposes
- [ ] Bot provides proactive notifications:
  - Deployment completed/failed
  - Policy violations detected
  - Anomalies detected by Observability Agent

### Could Have
- [ ] Support for Microsoft Teams in addition to Slack
- [ ] Voice interface integration (Alexa/Google Assistant)
- [ ] Multi-step wizards for complex workflows
- [ ] Bot learns from user corrections (feedback loop)
- [ ] Integration with incident management (PagerDuty, Opsgenie)

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Architecture Components
```
Web Browser / Slack/Teams Client
  └─> Chatbot Agent (Podman container :8003)
      ├─> Claude API for intent recognition
      ├─> Agent Router (maps intent to agent)
      └─> Executes via:
          ├─> Planner Agent (:8000) for workflows
          ├─> CodeGen Agent (:8001) for code generation
          ├─> Remediation Agent (:8002) for auto-fixes
          ├─> Migration Agent (:8004) for pipeline conversion
          ├─> MCP GitHub Server (:8100) for GitHub operations
          └─> Returns formatted response
```

### Chatbot Agent Implementation
- **Runtime**: FastAPI container (Python 3.11)
- **NLP Engine**: Claude API for natural language understanding
- **Intent Classification**: Map user input to agent actions
- **Session Management**: Local JSON store (`/data/db/chatbot-sessions.json`)
- **Web UI**: Built-in HTML/CSS/JS served via FastAPI static files

### Example Conversation Flows

#### Flow 1: Deploy Service
```
User: Deploy user-service to staging

Bot: I'll deploy user-service to staging. Let me check the latest version...
     ✅ Latest version: v1.5.2 (commit: abc123f)

     Deployment strategy: Rolling update
     Estimated time: 3-5 minutes

     Proceed with deployment?
     [Yes, deploy] [No, cancel]

User: [Clicks "Yes, deploy"]

Bot: Deployment started! 🚀
     Deployment ID: dep-78901
     [View in ArgoCD] [View logs]

     I'll notify you when it's complete.

[3 minutes later]

Bot: ✅ Deployment successful!
     user-service v1.5.2 is now live in staging
     - All health checks passed
     - 0 errors in the last 5 minutes
     [View metrics] [View service]
```

#### Flow 2: Troubleshoot Error
```
User: Why is user-service failing?

Bot: Let me investigate user-service issues... 🔍

     Found 127 errors in the last hour:

     Top Error (89 occurrences):
     💥 DatabaseConnectionError: Connection timeout to postgres

     Likely cause: Database connection pool exhausted

     Recommendations:
     1. Check RDS instance CPU/memory (currently at 92% CPU)
     2. Review slow queries in the last hour
     3. Consider scaling RDS instance or increasing connection pool

     [View logs] [View metrics] [Scale service]
```

#### Flow 3: Create Service
```
User: Create a new REST API service called order-service with PostgreSQL

Bot: I'll create order-service with the following configuration:
     - Type: REST API
     - Language: Python (default)
     - Database: PostgreSQL
     - Environment: dev (default)

     Do you want to customize any of these?
     [Use defaults] [Customize]

User: [Clicks "Use defaults"]

Bot: Creating order-service... ⏳
     Workflow ID: wf-34567

     Progress:
     ✅ Repository created
     ⏳ Generating code...
     ⏳ Creating infrastructure...
     ⏳ Setting up CI/CD...

     [View progress in Backstage]

[5 minutes later]

Bot: ✅ order-service is ready!
     - Repository: https://gitlab.com/yourorg/order-service
     - Backstage: https://backstage.company.com/catalog/order-service
     - Dev URL: https://order-service.dev.company.com

     Next steps:
     • Clone the repo and start coding
     • Review the README for local development setup
```

### Intent Recognition
**Categories**:
1. **Query Intent**: Status, history, metrics, logs
2. **Action Intent**: Create, deploy, rollback, scale
3. **Analysis Intent**: Why, explain, troubleshoot
4. **Help Intent**: How to, what is, documentation

**Claude Prompt Template**:
```
You are a DevOps assistant. Analyze the user's message and extract:
1. Intent category (query/action/analysis/help)
2. Target entity (service name, pipeline, workflow)
3. Required parameters
4. Confidence score

User message: "{user_input}"
Context: {session_context}

Output JSON:
{
  "intent": "deploy",
  "entity": "user-service",
  "parameters": {"environment": "staging"},
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "clarifications_needed": []
}
```

### API Integration Map
| User Intent | API Endpoint | Agent |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Create service | POST /workflows | Planner (:8000) → CodeGen (:8001) |
| Migrate pipeline | POST /migrate | Migration (:8004) |
| Check deployment | GET /workflows/{id} | Planner (:8000) |
| Auto-fix issue | POST /remediate | Remediation (:8002) |
| GitHub operations | MCP tools | MCP GitHub (:8100) |

### Security & Authorization
- **Authentication**: Environment variable-based (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
- **Audit Trail**: All commands logged via structured JSON logging

### Database Schema (Local JSON Store)
**Collection**: `chatbot_sessions` (stored in `/data/db/chatbot-sessions.json`)
- Key: `session_id` (String)
- Fields: `user_id`, `context`, `last_interaction`, `ttl`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Chatbot Agent container deployed (port 8003)
- [ ] All agent containers running on `agentic-local` network
- [ ] MCP GitHub Server container deployed (port 8100)
- [ ] Local data volume mounted at `/data`
- [ ] Claude API access for NLP (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
- [ ] GitHub token set in `.env` file

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Intent recognition with various phrasings
   - Parameter extraction accuracy
   - Error handling for malformed inputs
2. **Integration Tests**:
   - End-to-end flow: Web UI → Chatbot Agent → Target Agent → Response
   - Authorization checks for different roles
   - Session context persistence
3. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Recruit 5-10 developers for beta testing
   - Collect feedback on natural language understanding
   - Measure task completion rate and user satisfaction

## Estimated Effort
**13-15 story points** (3-4 weeks for 1 developer)

### Breakdown
- Slack bot setup and authentication: 2 days
- Claude API integration for NLP: 3 days
- Intent router and agent integration: 4 days
- Conversation context management: 2 days
- Interactive components (buttons, menus): 3 days
- Authorization and security: 3 days
