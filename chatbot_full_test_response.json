  "message": "Okay, I can help you with that. First, I'll create a new public repository called 'test-my-app123' for your Python web application. Then, I'll set up the standard gitflow branching structure within that repository, including the 'develop', 'feature/*', 'release/*', and 'hotfix/*' branches. Once that's done, I can generate a sample Python web application for you to use as a starting point. Does this sound good? Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements.\n\n✅ Repository created successfully!\n- Name: darrylbowler72/test-my-app123\n- URL: https://github.com/darrylbowler72/test-my-app123\n- Private: False",
